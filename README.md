# jobs-app-demo
Static mirror for checking out purposes only.

Contains code for both the backend and the mobile app, as well as some deployment scripts/configuration. The backend was deployed on AWS EC2, with S3 for storage. uWSGI was chosen against gunicorn because I found it easier to configure for things like logging.

Does not contain: sensitive information pertaining to AWS accounts, images used in the mobile app.
